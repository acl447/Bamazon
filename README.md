# Bamazon

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront with a customer view and a manager view. As a customer, you can order items and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a manager, you can view all products in stock or those low in inventory, add more of an item in stock, or add a new product to the inventory. 

To use the Bamazon app, first clone the project to your computer.
